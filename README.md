# SparkSched

SparkSched is a Java program designed to suggest efficient tasks based on a partition-based algorithm utilizing Depth-First Search (DFS) and Variable Size Decrease. This algorithm is particularly useful in task scheduling scenarios where tasks are associated with specific dates and times.

## Description

SparkSched provides functionality to input tasks along with their respective date and time information. It then suggests an efficient sequence of tasks to execute based on the provided inputs and the implemented algorithm.

## Features

- Input task names and associated date and time.
- Perform DFS traversal to suggest an efficient sequence of tasks.
- Utilize a partition-based algorithm for efficient task scheduling.
- Dynamically adjust task sequence based on priority and dependencies.
